GAMA code for MAS simulations of D. discoideum colonies.

It generates the simulations described in Proverbio, D., Gallo, L., Passalacqua, B. et al. Assessing the robustness of decentralized gathering: a multi-agent approach on micro-biological systems. Swarm Intell 14, 313–331 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11721-020-00186-y

The code works with Gama Platform 1.8 (https://gama-platform.github.io/)

## Objective

The code initializes and run Multi Agent System simulations of colonies of the social amoeba D. discoideum. 


## Description
The code is subdivided in the following sections:

* Parameters: Default parameters are consistent with biological values, when translated in simulation units.
* Init: initialization and save statements
* Species: definition and implementation of the main agents: grid of bacteria (Env), Amoeba, cAMP, obstacle
* Run and visualization

## Use and Acknowledge
The code is free to be used and modified. For instance, additional methods can be implemented for the agent Amoeba. Simulations can be also performed for didactical purposes in the field of self organization and emergence.
